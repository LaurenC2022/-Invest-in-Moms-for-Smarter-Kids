Women’s education is under valued in society. I am conducting a social impact analysis to use data in the fight for women’s empowerment. I will be using data from Colombia University to visualize the benefits a mother’s education can have on her child’s future. I will compare the mother’s impact vs. the father’s impact on child’s development.
